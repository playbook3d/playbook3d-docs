Playbook 3D is a generative media platform designed for running ComfyUI in the cloud, enabling users to build, manage, and deploy AI workflows as scalable, serverless APIs or shareable  playgrounds.

## Key Features

### 1. No-code/Low-code Workflow Builder

Playbook allows users to design and execute AI workflows without writing any code. The intuitive **ComfyUI** interface lets you visually connect different components (nodes) to build power AI models.

* **Drag-and-drop**

   

  **node editor**

  : Build workflows by connecting pre-built components

* **Custom nodes:**

   Extend your workflows with custom nodes that suit your specific AI needs

* **Workflow versioning**

  : Save and track different versions of your workflows, allowing easy collaboration and experimentation.

### 2. Cloud GPU Infrastructure

Playbook takes the hassle out of infrastructure management by providing access to powerful cloud GPUs, including **T4, L4, A100, and H100 GPUS,** allowing users to scale their workflows efficiently.&#x20;

* **Choose from top of line GPU types**

   based on your performance needs

* **Seamless scaling**

  : Run large AI models and workflows without worrying about hardware limitation

* **GPU Management:**

   Monitor GPU usage and optimize workflows for faster execution

### 3. Built for teams

Playbook is designed for teams to collaborate on building AI workflows. Multiple users can work on the same project, with built-in **version control** and **role-based access.**

* **Project-based collaboration:**

   Add team members to projects with specific permissions (owners, collaborators).

### 4. API and UI Playgrounds

Playbook simplifies the deployment of AI workflows into scalable APIs and shareable UI Playgrounds.&#x20;

* **Deploy as APIs**

  : Transform AI workflows into APIs with one click.

* **UI Playgrounds**

  : Deploy workflows as 

  **interactive AI applications**

   that can be shared via public URLs, enabling users to access your AI models with ease.

* **Scalability**

  : Built-in scalability features ensure that your APIs can handle increasing traffic seamlessly.
