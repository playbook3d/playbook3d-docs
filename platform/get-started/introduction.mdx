---

Playbook 3D is a generative media platform to help discover, design, and run AI workflows at scale.\
\
Some features include:

- Pre-built, production-ready templates you can use in a single click or API call
- Instant no-code interfaces for every app on Playbook, with zero extra configuration
- Reliable, horizontally scaling infrastructure based on traffic

## Getting started

Every account comes with $5 of credit to get you started

- [Sign up](https://beta.playbook3d.com/) to start running some of our template workflows out of the box. 
- Upload your own ComfyUI workflows. The intuitiv ComfyUI interface lets you visually connect different components (nodes) to build powerful AI models

### Cloud GPU Infrastructure

Playbook takes the hassle out of infrastructure management by providing access to powerful cloud GPUs, including **T4, L4, A100, and H100 GPUS,** allowing users to scale their workflows efficiently. 

- **Choose from top of line GPU types**

  based on your performance needs
- **Seamless scaling**

  : Run large AI models and workflows without worrying about hardware limitation
- **GPU Management:**

  Monitor GPU usage and optimize workflows for faster execution

### Built for teams

Playbook is designed for teams to collaborate on building AI workflows. Multiple users can work on the same project, with built-in **version control** and **role-based access.**

- **Project-based collaboration:**

  Add team members to projects with specific permissions (owners, collaborators).

### API and UI Playgrounds

Playbook simplifies the deployment of AI workflows into scalable APIs and shareable UI Playgrounds. 

- **Deploy as APIs**

  : Transform AI workflows into APIs with one click.
- **UI Playgrounds**

  : Deploy workflows as 

  **interactive AI applications**

   that can be shared via public URLs, enabling users to access your AI models with ease.
- **Scalability**

  : Built-in scalability features ensure that your APIs can handle increasing traffic seamlessly.
