Playbook's Python SDK integrates any python application with ComfyUI. It allows you to quickly create images and videos using generative diffusion models.

## How To Use Playbook's Python SDK
<Steps>
    <Step title="Install our SDK">
        <b>Pip install is here!</b>. You can install Playbook3d via 
        ```python
        pip install playbook3d
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Import the sdk">
        Import the sdk into your code with:
            ```python
            from playbook3d.playbookNetworkClient import PlaybookClient
            ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialize the client">
        Create an Initialize function and set your api key: <br />
        ```python
        def setup_playbook_client(self):
            self.playbookClient = PlaybookClient()
            self.playbookClient.set_api_key({"insert your api key here"})
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a run
After you pull data from the sdk, you can queue a generation using:
```python
self.playbookClient.run_workflow(PlaybookRun: run)
```

## Getting your results
You can either get your results from the [Playbook webclient](https://beta.playbook3d.com) logging in with the same account or by calling:
```python
self.playbookClient.get_run_result({PlaybookRun: run})
```
