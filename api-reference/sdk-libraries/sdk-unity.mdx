Playbook's Unity SDK integrates the editor with ComfyUI. It allows you to quickly create and refine textures for your
scene using generative diffusion models.

## Adding Playbook To Your Project

<Warning>
  The Unity SDK only works on projects that are using the Universal Render
  Pipeline. If your project is not using URP, you can add it by following this
  guide: [Installing URP into an existing
  Project](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.1/manual/InstallURPIntoAProject.html)
</Warning>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open up the Package Manager">
        Once you have your Unity project open, go to Window -> Package Manager. In the package manager, click the plus 
        icon on the top left and click "Add package from git URL...".

    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the package through Github">
        Enter the link provided by our repository: [Unity SDK](https://github.com/playbook3d/playbook3d-unity-sdk)

        <Frame>![Github URL](../../images/UnitySDK/GithubRepo.png)</Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add the dependency">
        Playbook is dependent on `SocketIOUnity`, so make sure to also add it to your project using the same steps as
        before: [Socket IO Unity](https://github.com/itisnajim/SocketIOUnity)
    </Step>

## How To Use Playbook

<Steps>
    <Step title="Attach the PlaybookSDK component">
        To begin using Playbook, simply attach the `PlaybookSDK` component to your main camera.

        <Frame>
            ![PlaybookSDK Component](../../images/UnitySDK/PlaybookSDKComponent.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add your API key">
        Add your Playbook API key in the `Playbook Account API Key` field. You can grab your API key from your
        [Playbook](https://beta.playbook3d.com/) account.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Select your team + workflow">
        Once you enter Play mode in Unity, the `Teams` and `Workflows` properties will be populated with your respective
        teams and workflows. Select the ones you want to work with.

        <Warning>
            Note that you will need to exit and re-enter Play mode to refresh teams and workflows.
        </Warning>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start capturing">
        You can now start capturing a single frame or an image sequence by clicking the buttons.

        You can check if your workflow was received by our servers by opening up the workflow you selected in the [Playbook Dashboard](https://beta.playbook3d.com).
        Open up your browser's console and you should receive a queued run:

</Step>

    <Step title="Wait for the render">
        Once the render is complete, you'll find the URL to your image in the `PlaybookSDK` component. Copy this link,
        paste it on your local internet browser, and your image will start downloading.

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Adding to Mask Pass

You can further customize your renders by manipulating the mask pass.
To add or remove GameObjects from mask groups, you can call the following methods:

<Warning>
  GameObjects that do not have a `Renderer` component attached cannot be added
  to a mask group.
</Warning>

```cs

// To add
PlaybookSDK.AddObjectToMaskGroup(GameObject maskObject, MaskGroup maskGroup);
PlaybookSDK.AddObjectsToMaskGroup(List<GameObject> maskObjects, MaskGroup maskGroup);

// To remove
PlaybookSDK.RemoveObjectFromMaskGroup(GameObject maskObject);
PlaybookSDK.RemoveObjectsFromMaskGroup(List<GameObject> maskObjects);

```

Additionally, you can also change the mask group of the background through these methods:

```cs

// To add
PlaybookSDK.SetBackgroundMaskGroup(MaskGroup maskGroup);

// To remove
PlaybookSDK.RemoveBackgroundMaskGroup();

```

<Note>
  Playbook supports up to 7 mask groups which are specified by the `MaskGroup`
  property. `MaskGroup` also includes the "Catch-all" mask, which is the default
  group for objects that are not part of a mask group.
</Note>

## Listening to Results Received

To listen to workflow results when they are received, you can subscribe to `ResultReceived()` given in `PlaybookSDK.cs`, which returns the result as a url `string`.

```cs
    private void OnEnable()
    {
        PlaybookSDK.ResultReceived += EventToDoWhenReceived;
    }

    private void OnDisable()
    {
        PlaybookSDK.ResultReceived -= EventToDoWhenReceived;
    }
```

## Overriding Node Inputs

If you would like to manually override node inputs, you can do so by using `OverrideNodeInputs()`
given in `PlaybookSDK.cs`.

To call `OverrideNodeInputs()`, you must provide a dictionary on inputs to override the desired Playbook nodes in your selected workflow, where the `key` is the node ID and the `value` is the new value. For example:

```cs
Dictionary<string, object> inputs = new Dictionary<string, object> {
                ["11"] = "cats in outer space",
            };
PlaybookSDK.OverrideNodeInputs(inputs);
```

Dashboard display of node IDs per workflow is in progress. Currently, node IDs can be found by opening browser console in the [Playbook Dashboard](https://beta.playbook3d.com) and searching for `"Playbook Nodes:"`.
