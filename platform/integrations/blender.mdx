#### Masks

If you decide to render a mask pass, you can organize the objects in your scene by different masks. You can add a new mask by clicking the "Add" button.

You can then add an object to the selected mask in two ways:

- Select the desired object through the dropdown
- Select the object through the blender editor. The add-on will detect when an object was selected and the "Add" button will become available.

Playbook supports up to 7 masks.

### Run Your Workflows

You can now run your workflow!

Either capture a single frame by clicking "Single Image Capture" or capture a series of continuous frames by first clicking "Start Sequence Capture" and then clicking "End Sequence Capture" once you want your sequence to end.
