## How To Use Playbook's Python SDK
<Steps>
    <Step title="Git clone the sdk">
        Git clone our repository into your project, <b>Pip install version is coming soon!</b>.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Import the sdk">
        Import the sdk into your code with:
            ```python
            from playbookNetworkClient import PlaybookClient
            ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Initialize the client">
        Create an Initialize function and set your api key: <br />
        ```python
        def setup_playbook_client(self):
            self.playbookClient = PlaybookClient()
            self.playbookClient.set_api_key({"insert your api key here"})
        ```

## Creating a run
After you pull data from the sdk, you can queue a generation using:
```python
self.playbookClient.run_workflow({"Add the PlaybookWorkflow you want to run"})
```

## Getting your results
You can either get your results from the [Playbook webclient](https://beta.playbook3d.com) logging in with the same account or by calling:
```python
self.playbookClient.get_run_result({"Add the PlaybookRun you're requestin results from"})
